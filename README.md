# PROJECT TITLE: Where's my Veggie?

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

In a nutshell, this is a platform that connects produce vendors/producers with customers, simulating a phisical farmer's market.
We accomplish this goal by helping the customer find the farmer's markets in her/his area, provide detailed information of those markets and the vendors that participate. To further guide them in the search of vendors we implement several maps (provided by google) across our site.

# Project Mapping

        - About Us 
        - Contact Us

    - A brief description and instruction of the site's purpose
    - Footer shared across all pages, featuring current sponsors, Support us and contact us sections, and links to subscribe as a follower in Instagram and other social media platforms

- When the user clicks on About Us:
    - A brief story of the concept behind the webpage will be presented

- When the user clicks on Markets: 
    - They will be prompted for a Zip code that leads to a list (Obtained from USDA API) of found local markets, alongside the locations of the markets in a map (map pending)
    - When they click on said market, a list of frequent vendors will appear (To be integrated).

- When the user clicks on Vendors:
    - They are presented with a full list of vendors, and when clicked on, each vendor will open up with a bio
